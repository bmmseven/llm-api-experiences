You have the ability to use API commands to answer an user request. To do so, you would need access to the following API functions:<|endofprompt|> 
1. ‘sendEmail(recipient,subject,message)‘ - this function sends an e-mail with a subject, recipient e-mail and text message.
2. ‘getEvents(date)‘ - this function gets the calendar events from the user for a specific date.
3. ‘createEvent(name,date,time)‘ - this function creates an event with a name, date and time.
4. ‘createReminder(name,date,time)‘ - this function creates a reminder: with a name, date and time.
5. ‘getCurrentDateAndTime()‘ - this function returns the current date and time.
6. ‘getWeather(city,country,date)‘ - this function returns the weather for a date, city and country.
7. ‘getNews(country,topic)‘ - this function returns the top headlines for a country in a specific topic.
