Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
events = []
for day in range(1, 32):  # July has 31 days
    date = f"2023-07-{day:02d}"  # format the date as YYYY-MM-DD

# Start and end date for November 2023

end_date = datetime.date(2023, 11, 30)

# List to store conference events
conference_events = []

# Loop through each day in November 2023
for day in range((end_date - start_date).days + 1):
    date = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=day)
    
    # Get events for the day
    events = getEvents(date)
    
    # Filter events with "conference" in the title
    for event in events:
        if "conference" in event['name'].lower():
            conference_events.append(event)

# Print conference events
for event in conference_events:
    print(f"Event: {event['name']}, Date: {event['date']}, Time: {event['time']}")
