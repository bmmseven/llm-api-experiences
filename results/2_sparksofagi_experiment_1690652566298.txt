USER: What events are scheduled at my home location in July 2023?
AI: To answer this user request, we would need to use the 'getEvents(date)' API function. However, we don't have a specific date in July 2023, so we would need to call this function for each day in July 2023. 

Here is an example of how you might do this:

```python
import datetime

# Start date
start_date = datetime.date(2023, 7, 1)

# End date
end_date = datetime.date(2023, 7, 31)

delta = datetime.timedelta(days=1)

while start_date <= end_date:
    events = getEvents(start_date)
    for event in events:
        if event['location'] == 'home':
            print(event)
    start_date += delta
```

This script will print out all the events at the home location for each day in July 2023.

```python
import datetime

# Create a list to store all the events
events = []

# Loop through each day of November 2023
for day in range(1, 31):
    # Create a date string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    date = datetime.date(2023, 11, day).isoformat()
    
    # Get the events for this date
    day_events = getEvents(date)
    
    # Loop through each event
    for event in day_events:
        # If the event title contains the word "conference"
        if "conference" in event['name'].lower():
            # Add the event to the list
            events.append(event)

# Return the list of events
return events
```

AI: Sure, let's check your calendar for tomorrow. 

First, we need to get tomorrow's date. We can use the 'getCurrentDateAndTime()' function for this. Then, we add one day to the current date to get tomorrow's date. After that, we can use the 'getEvents(date)' function to get all the events for tomorrow.

Here is the API command:

```python
current_date = getCurrentDateAndTime()
tomorrow_date = current_date + timedelta(days=1)
events = getEvents(tomorrow_date)

Here is how you would use the 'getEvents(date)' function:

```

This will return all events for November 11, 2023. You would then need to manually check each event to see if the specific contact is involved, which is not currently supported by the API functions provided.

AI: Sure, I can help with that. However, I need to clarify that the 'getEvents(date)' function only retrieves events for a specific date, not for a whole month. Therefore, I would need to call this function 31 times (once for each day in May) to get all the events for May 2023. 

Here is how I would do it:

```python
events_in_may = []
for day in range(1, 32):
    date = f"2023-05-{day:02d}"
    events = getEvents(date)
    events_in_may.extend(events)
```

This will give me a list of all events in May 2023. However, you also asked for events at your office location. If the 'getEvents(date)' function returns events with location information, I can filter the events like this:

```python
office_events_in_may = [event for event in events_in_may if event.location == "office"]
```

This will give me a list of all office events in May 2023.

First, we need to calculate the dates for the next weekend. Let's assume today is 2021-09-20 (Monday). The next weekend would be 2021-09-25 (Saturday) and 2021-09-26 (Sunday).

Then, we can use the `getEvents(date)` function to get the events for these dates.

Here is how you would do it:

```python
# Get the events for next Saturday
saturday_events = getEvents('2021-09-25')

# Get the events for next Sunday
sunday_events = getEvents('2021-09-26')

# Combine the events
weekend_events = saturday_events + sunday_events

# Return the events
return weekend_events
```

Please note that the dates used in this example are hardcoded for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would use the `getCurrentDateAndTime()` function to get the current date and then calculate the dates for the next weekend.
